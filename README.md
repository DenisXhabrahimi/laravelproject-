Doctor-Patient Management System (Laravel)

This project is a Doctor-Patient management platform developed using Laravel. The website allows doctors to securely manage their patients' data, while patients can access their medical information. Key features include:

Doctor's Dashboard: Doctors can view, update, and manage patient records, medical history, diagnoses, prescriptions, and appointment schedules.
Patient Portal: Patients can securely access their medical records, view prescriptions, book appointments, and track their health progress.
User Authentication & Role Management: Secure login system with separate roles for doctors and patients to ensure data privacy.
Medical Record Management: Doctors can input detailed patient information and track treatment history, making it easier to monitor ongoing care.
Appointment Scheduling: Patients can book appointments with doctors, and both can view upcoming visits.
Notifications & Reminders: Email or SMS notifications to remind patients of upcoming appointments or prescription renewals.
Responsive Design: Accessible on all devices, including mobile phones and tablets, for easy access by both doctors and patients.
